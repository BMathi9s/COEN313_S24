To show the delta cycle execution of the
vsim simulator, from the Wave window select :

 View -> Expanded Time -> Deltas mode


Then , select on of :
 
 View -> Expanded Time -> Expand All
                          Expand Range
                          Expand Cursor


depending on whether you wish to view all the delta cycles,
or the delta cycles associatate with where the View Cursor
has been placed, or the delta cycles within a range.

The simulator expands the delta cycles as shows the
various delta cycles using the notation:

2ns + 1    2 ns + 2   
      --        ----
    first        second
    delta        delta


add an internal signal to your DO file, then run the simulation
and then do the above to view the various delta cycles associated
when a top-level input port changes at a particular simulation time.
